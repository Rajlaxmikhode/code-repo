# Daily Python Practice 🐍

This repository contains my **daily Python practice code** as I learn and improve step by step.

The goal of this repo is **learning by doing** — writing code every day, making mistakes, and getting better over time.

---

## 📌 What’s inside

- Basic Python concepts
- Loops, conditionals, and functions
- Simple problem solving
- Beginner-level DSA practice
- Small experiments and practice scripts

Each file represents something I practiced on a particular day.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this repository

- Build consistency
- Track my learning progress
- Practice writing code regularly
- Improve problem-solving skills

This is **not a polished project repo**, but a learning journal in code form.

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Code quality may vary as this reflects my learning stage
- Earlier code may be messy — that’s intentional and part of growth
- Improvements will come with time and experience

## 📅 Status

Actively updated as I continue learning Python.
